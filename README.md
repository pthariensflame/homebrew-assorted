# Ptharien's Flame's Assorted Formulae and Casks

Just a tap to put the formulae and casks I can't have in official
taps.  Feel free to use these!  I'll try my best to maintain them, and
help in that is more than welcome.

## How do I install these formulae/casks?

```bash
brew install pthariensflame/assorted/<formula>
brew install pthariensflame/assorted/<casks>
```

Or `brew tap pthariensflame/assorted` and then `brew install
<formula>` or `brew install <cask>`.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's
documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
