  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      To enable ble.sh by default, add the following to the beginning of your ~/.bash_profile:
        [[ $- == *i* ]] && source #{opt_libexec/"ble/ble.sh"} --noattach
      and also add the following to the end of your ~/.bash_profile:
        ((_ble_bash)) && ble-attach

      We highly recommend using a more up-to-date version of bash than the one macOS comes with by default.  You can install that with:
        brew install bash
    EOS
  end

  test do
    # This software is impossible to test in an automated fashion;
    # the best we can do is test that it did in fact create the top-level script.
